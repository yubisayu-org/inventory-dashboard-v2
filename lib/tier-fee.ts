// Bracket resolution for the Tier Fee method: from which base amount upward to
// charge which fee.
//
// No imports, same rule as lib/kurs-tiers.ts and lib/pricing.ts, so the form can run
// it directly. `minBase` is INCLUSIVE and the HIGHEST matching minimum wins, so row
// order is irrelevant — deliberately the same rule as resolveTieredKurs(), because
// two different answers to "which bracket applies" in one app would be a bug waiting
// to happen.
//
// Two scopes, named by tier_fee_brackets.scope (see migrations 056/057). BOTH are
// denominated in rupiah — floors and fees alike — and differ only in which base cost
// they are matched against, and in who has the last word:
//
//   'rupiah'  the TYPED base cost of a Markup row with no country. A SUGGESTION only:
//             it pre-fills the form's Fee field, the owner can type over it, and
//             nothing recomputes it afterwards.
//   'valas'   the DERIVED base cost (valas × kurs + freight) of a Markup row with a
//             country, shared by every country. Resolved server-side on every save, so
//             unlike the rupiah set this one IS authoritative.
//
// The asymmetry is not an oversight: the rupiah fee is typed by a human and has been
// since before this table existed, while the valas fee is never typed at all.
//
// Before 056 the valas set was per-country and denominated in each country's own
// currency. Sharing one set is only coherent because the fee is rupiah: a shared
// `fee = 20` would otherwise mean 20 CNY for China and 20 JPY for Japan.
