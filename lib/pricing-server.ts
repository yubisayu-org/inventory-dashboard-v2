// Server-side pricing authority for the methods whose margin is NOT typed by the
// user.
//
// The product routes otherwise store whatever `price` the browser sends, which is
// how this app has always worked and is left alone here: repricing the whole
// catalogue server-side is a separate decision with its own migration risk.
//
// Two cases are different and get recomputed:
//
//   tier_kurs         — its entire margin IS one number, the inflated rate, and that
//                       rate is not typed at all: it is looked up from
//                       country_kurs_tiers. A client-supplied `tieredKurs` would be
//                       a client-supplied margin.
//   flat_fee          — the fee is one global setting, which is the only thing
//                       distinguishing this method from Tier Fee. If the body could
//                       supply it, the two would be the same method with different
//                       labels.
//
// tier_fee — in EITHER mode — keeps the client-computed fee: it has always been
// typed on the product, with the relevant bracket set (rupiah or the shared valas
// one) merely pre-filling the field, and taking that over would overwrite every
// manual fee in the catalogue. Valas mode's PRICE is still recomputed here, because
// its base cost is derived from valas/rate/freight rather than typed — only the fee
// itself is trusted from the body, falling back to the bracket resolution when a
// caller omits it. Which mode a row is in is decided by whether it has a country —
// see migration 053.
//
// All lookups happen here, inside the write transaction, so the value that priced the
// row is the value that was committed.
//
// The math itself lives in lib/pricing.ts, which has no imports and runs unchanged
// in the browser for the form's live preview.
